You are a senior React + UX engineer building a mobile-first personal workout tracking web application.
The app is designed for daily gym usage on a phone, fast logging, zero friction, and long-term progress tracking.

Core Goals

Track predefined workouts (Push / Legs / Pull / Cardio / Full Body)

Allow exercise alternatives if equipment is unavailable

Persist workout data locally and optionally in the cloud

Visually track strength, volume, consistency, and cardio

Minimal, elegant UI that feels calm, fast, and motivating

Optimized for Planet Fitness + home workouts

Hosted on Vercel

Tech Stack

React 18

Vite

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

LocalStorage / IndexedDB (primary persistence)

Optional: Supabase for cloud sync (future-ready)

No heavy UI libraries — build clean components

UX & Design Principles

Mobile-first (375px baseline)

Thumb-friendly buttons

One-hand usage

No modals unless necessary

Minimal color palette (light/dark mode)

Fast load (<1s perceived)

Everything should be loggable in under 15 seconds

App Structure
Main Screens

Home / Today

Workout Session

Exercise Detail

Progress

Settings

Home / Today Screen

Shows today’s workout based on weekly plan

Displays:

Workout name

Exercises count

Estimated time

Primary CTA: “Start Workout”

Secondary:

“View Plan”

“Progress”

Workout Session Screen

List of exercises in order

Each exercise card shows:

Name

Sets × Reps

Last performed weight

Quick “+” / “–” weight adjust

Tap exercise → opens Exercise Detail

Swipe gesture to mark set complete

Persistent session state (page refresh safe)

Exercise Detail Screen

Each exercise must support:

Primary Exercise

Name

Target muscles

Prescribed sets/reps

Notes field

Alternatives Section

List of equivalent alternatives

Each alternative has:

Reason (e.g. “no bench”, “busy gym”)

One-tap swap into workout

Swapping should:

Log which alternative was used

Preserve progression history separately

History Section

Last 5 sessions

Weight × reps trend

Simple visual indicator (↑ ↓ →)

Workout Data Model

Use a structured schema:

Workout

id

name

dayType (push, pull, legs, cardio, full)

exercises[]

Exercise

id

name

muscleGroup

sets

reps

alternatives[]

Logged Set

exerciseId

date

weight

reps

completed (boolean)

Session

workoutId

date

duration

totalVolume

notes

Progress Screen

Must visualize:

Strength

Best weight per exercise

Trend arrows (not complex charts)

Volume

Weekly total volume

Simple bar representation

Consistency

Workout streak

Days trained this month

Cardio

Total minutes

Average duration

Keep visuals clean and non-intimidating.

Persistence Rules

Use LocalStorage or IndexedDB

All data must persist across reloads

App must function offline

Data schema versioned for future migrations

Optional:

Cloud sync toggle (Supabase ready, not required)

Interaction Rules

No confirmation dialogs for routine actions

Undo instead of confirm

Haptic feedback where supported

Optimistic UI updates

Accessibility

Large tap targets

High contrast

Screen-reader friendly labels

Keyboard navigation supported

Performance Constraints

Avoid re-renders during workout session

Memoize heavy components

Lazy load progress visuals

Stretch Goals (Do Not Block MVP)

Calendar view

PR badges

Export data (CSV)

Apple Health / Google Fit integration

Output Expectations

Clean, readable code

Clear folder structure

Reusable components

Comments explaining data flow

Ready to deploy on Vercel

Important Mindset

This app is for real-world gym usage, not a demo.
Every decision should reduce friction, increase adherence, and make the user want to come back tomorrow.
